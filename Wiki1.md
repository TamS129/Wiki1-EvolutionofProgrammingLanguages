##Introduction
    The creation of the original C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie in 1970 at Bell Labs. Once the C programming language had been introduced, other programmers within Bell Labs began experimenting with the capabilities of their new program. This experimentation would later lead Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 to create an expansion of the C language that allowed for both high-level and low-level programming (also known as Middle-level programming) called C++.

      During his time working for Bell Labs, Bjarne Stroustrup was working on his PHD thesis for the Computing Laboratory of Cambridge University. He originally worked with a programming language known as Simula and enjoyed the object-oriented class structure that Simula provided. However, during his thesis Bjarne noticed that the programming language did not scale well for the simulator he had created. Although Simula did not help him complete his thesis. Simula would inspire Bjarne to create a new C language that would allow for programmers to build complex systems using high-level abstract programming while also having an ability to access the hardware using low-level programming. 
    
      This idea would lead him to create the first iteration of C++ known as C with classes. The name C with classes refers to the class structures that were implemented into the language. C with classes was an extension of the C language that included the above-mentioned class structures, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance. C with classes allowed programmers to write modular and efficient code without the limitations that other high-level programs such as Simula had. Due to the fact that C with classes was a language built using the already existing C language, compilers had already been implemented for many platforms at the time. Making the portability of C with classes much easier for general use programming. C with classes also improved the security issues that the original C language had been struggling with at the time. Leading for more efficient and safer features than its original predecessor.
    
      However, before C with classes was released to the public in 1983 the language was renamed to C++ by Rick Mascitti. The ++ referencing the increment operator that was actually not existent in the previous C language. This version of C++ would also be given more additional features to the language like virtual functions, improved type-checking and C++ style comments, and references.
	  
      It wouldn’t be until 1985 when C++ would become a mainstream programming language with the release of the first edition manual of 'The C++ Programming Language’. During this time period would also bring new features to C++ with a new system called CFont. CFont would allow the translation of C++ into C programs which aided in the development of complex programs.
