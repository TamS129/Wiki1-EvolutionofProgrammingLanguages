# Evolution of C++ Programming Language

## Introduction
The creation of the original C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie in 1970 at Bell Labs. Once the C programming language had been introduced, other programmers within Bell Labs began experimenting with the capabilities of their new program. This experimentation would later lead Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 to create an expansion of the C language that allowed for both high-level and low-level programming (also known as Middle-level programming) called C++.

## The Evolution of C++
During his time working for Bell Labs, Bjarne Stroustrup was working on his PHD thesis for the Computing Laboratory of Cambridge University. He originally worked with a programming language known as Simula and enjoyed the object-oriented class structure that Simula provided. However, during his thesis Bjarne noticed that the programming language did not scale well for the simulator he had created. Although Simula did not help him complete his thesis. Simula would inspire Bjarne to create a new C language that would allow for programmers to build complex systems using high-level abstract programming while also having an ability to access the hardware using low-level programming. 
    
This idea would lead him to create the first iteration of C++ known as C with classes. The name C with classes refers to the class structures that were implemented into the language. C with classes was an extension of the C language that included the above-mentioned class structures, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance. C with classes allowed programmers to write modular and efficient code without the limitations that other high-level programs such as Simula had. Due to the fact that C with classes was a language built using the already existing C language, compilers had already been implemented for many platforms at the time. Making the portability of C with classes much easier for general use programming. C with classes also improved the security issues that the original C language had been struggling with at the time. Leading for more efficient and safer features than its original predecessor.
    
However, before C with classes was released to the public in 1983 the language was renamed to C++ by Rick Mascitti. The ++ referencing the increment operator that was actually not existent in the previous C language. This version of C++ would also be given more additional features to the language like virtual functions, improved type-checking and C++ style comments, and references.
	  
It wouldn’t be until 1985 when C++ would become a mainstream programming language with the release of the first edition manual of 'The C++ Programming Language’. During this time period would also bring new features to C++ with a new system called CFont. CFont would allow the translation of C++ into C programs which aided in the development of complex programs.

C++ is a general-purpose language developed whose design was motivated by a need for a language that provided high-level abstraction but also closely managed system resources and hardware at the lower levels. This blend of capabilities has made C++ suitable for several kinds of applications, notably including system software, mobile applications, mainframes and mission-critical applications.

The primary use case for C++ has traditionally been in system software development. The language’s rich set of built-in functionalities and its ability to operate close to system hardware make it an optimal choice for developing operating systems, file systems and system drivers. For example, much of Microsoft Windows and carious Unix/Linux systems have been extensively developed using C++. The ability to manage memory usage explicitly and optimize performance makes C++ particularly useful in these areas, where efficiency is crucial.

While not originally designed for mobile development, C++ has found a significant niche in this field. It’s commonly used for game development or applications requiring high performance on mobile platforms. The language’s speed and the control it offers over system resources make it ideal for mobile games or applications that demand high-performance computation and graphics processing. Developers can use C++ to build parts of their applications that need to maximize the hardware’s capabilities, often in combination with higher-level languages.

Mainframe computers, which are critical for large-scale and enterprise-level applications requiring robust processing power, also rely on C++. Although not the most highlighted use case, C++ is used in mainframe environments to leverage its performance efficiency and low-level operation capabilities. Mainframes typically run applications such as large databases, transaction processing systems and applications requiring high-speed data processing. C++ features support these needs very effectively.

One of the most essential critical areas for C++ is in mission-critical applications where performance, reliability and direct hardware interaction are of utmost importance. Examples include applications for aviation control systems, medical systems and automotive safety systems. The reliability and fine control over hardware interactions that C++ offers are indispensable in these situations where a failure could result in significant consequences.

In summary, while C++ was originally designed with systems programming in mind, its versatility has allowed it to be adapted successfully across various other domains, including mobile development, mainframes and mission-critical applications. This adaptability and performance-oriented nature confirm C++ as a foundational tool in the many options of modern programming languages.

C++ remains a significant and actively used programming language in the software development landscape as of 2023. Its usage spans various domains, illustrating its adaptability and enduring relevance. Notably, C++ is not just maintained for legacy systems but is also employed in modern software development, including systems programming, game development, and real-time applications.

The adoption of new C++ standards like C++20 and C++23 shows a vibrant and evolving ecosystem. Innovations in these standards, such as modules and ranges, are designed to improve code quality and maintainability. According to a 2023 developer ecosystem survey by JetBrains, a majority of C++ users have transitioned to the more recent standards (C++14 and later), indicating that the language is far from being merely legacy.

In terms of tooling and integration, the landscape is diverse. Modern C++ development environments support extensive toolchains that include advanced IDEs like CLion and Visual Studio, which offer features tailored to contemporary C++ programming needs. These tools facilitate better code management and integration with other programming languages and technologies, which is crucial given the language's widespread use in complex and varied projects.

C++ also plays a pivotal role in educational and professional development contexts, with continuous updates and features that cater to both new and seasoned developers. The language's ability to work closely with hardware makes it indispensable for performance-critical applications, which is why it remains a preferred choice in sectors like embedded systems, video game development, and high-performance computing.

Overall, C++ continues to be a cornerstone in the programming world, adapting to new challenges and technological advances while supporting a wide array of applications and development needs.
